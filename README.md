<strong> How to fix the header file issue in c-mode? <strong/> <br/>
First go to the root of the project and create a local directory file:
```
M-x add-dir-local-variable RET c-mode RET RET
```
Then place this code inside the file, with the path to the library:
```
((c-mode . ((eval . (setq flycheck-clang-include-path
    (list
    (expand-file-name "library_dir_here")))))))
```
